  AuxExceptions

    Set of exception classes designed to simplify exception creation in
    specific situations (eg. index out of bounds, invalid variable value,
    system error, ...).

    This library is written in a way that allows complete rebasing of all
    implemented classes - that is, changing their common ancestor.
    To do that, you only need to copy the entire code from this unit
    (AuxException.pas) to a new unit of your choice, copy AuxException.inc
    (which implements everything) so it can be included, and change declaration
    of EBaseException to a class you desire to be a new common ancestor.
    You can also provide aliases to existing specialized exception classes, see
    current implementation on how to do that.

    Depending on defined symbols and compilation target, the implemented
    exception classes can also provide some more advanced information, eg.
    processor registers snapshot, simple stack trace, list of loaded modules
    and more.

      Registers snapshot:

        The stored register values are NOT the same as when the exception was
        raised, they are obtained inside of EAEExtendedException constructor
        and are therefore heavily polluted.
        There is, as far as I know, no general way of obtaining the values
        before the exception class is instantiated (well, there is, but it
        works only in 32bit Windows, so let's ignore it for now). If you are
        aware of any way on how to do that, please let me know.

      Stack trace:

        Only very simple stack tracing is implemented. First, the entire active
        area of stack is dumped (copied to a buffer) and then this buffer is
        scanned for stack frames - a list of stack frames is created (if any
        is recognized). For each frame, its start address (both real and
        in-dump), size and return address (corresponds to an address inside of
        function that was using this stack frame) are stored.

      Modules list:

        In Linux, this list is obtained by parsing "/proc/[pid]/maps" file, so
        it might not be completely accurate and might not show all loaded
        modules (eg. vdso).

      Threads list:

        In Linux, this list might not be accurate as the threads can be created
        and/or destroyed during the enumeration.

  Changelog:
    For detailed changelog and history please refer to this git repository:

      github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.AuxExceptions

  Dependencies:
  * AuxTypes    - github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.AuxTypes
  * SimpleCPUID - github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.SimpleCPUID
  * StrRect     - github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.StrRect
  * UInt64Utils - github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.UInt64Utils
  * WinFileInfo - github.com/TheLazyTomcat/Lib.WinFileInfo

  Libraries AuxTypes, SimpleCPUID and WinFileInfo are required only when
  PurePascal is not defined (note it might be automatically defined, depending
  on taget CPU, see source code for details) and symbol AllowExtendedException
  is defined.
  In addition, StrRect is only required when compiling for Windows and
  UInt64Utils only for Linux OS.
